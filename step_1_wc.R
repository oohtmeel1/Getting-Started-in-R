# Add a `dplyr` or `tidyr` function to the pipe chain in the code 
# at the bottom of this script to subset the `worldcup` dataset to 
# four columns, so that the first lines of the resulting data 
# frame (`wc_1`) look like this: 
#
##           Time   Passes  Tackles Saves
## Abdoun      16        6        0     0
## Abe        351      101       14     0
## Abidal     180       91        6     0
## Abou Diaby 270       111       5     0

# I have already loaded the `worldcup` data frame for you, so you 
# can explore it and test out your code in the console.
#
# When you are ready submit your answer, save the script and type 
# submit(), or type reset() to reset the script to its original 
# state.
