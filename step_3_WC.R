# After the previous question, you should have transformed the 
# `worldcup` data to look like this:
#
##       Time   Passes  Tackles     Saves
##   208.8639 84.52101 4.191597 0.6672269
#
# Now add a `dplyr` or `tidyr` function to the pipe chain in the 
# code at the bottom of this script so that the `wc_3` data frame looks 
# like this, with variable names in one column and the mean value
# of each variable in another column: 
#
##      var           mean
##     Time    208.8638655
##   Passes     84.5210084
##  Tackles      4.1915966
##    Saves      0.6672269
#
# I have already loaded the `worldcup` data frame for you, so you 
# can explore it and test out your code in the console.
#
# When you are ready submit your answer, save the script and type 
# submit(), or type reset() to reset the script to its original 
# state.
