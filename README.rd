\title{Welcome to your Lab Sandbox}

\section{}{
We’re glad you’re here! Let’s get you started in your Lab Sandbox with a quick \cr
README to answer any questions you might have. It’s preconfigured by Coursera \cr
and includes all dependencies (libraries and packages) to complete your work in \cr
RStudio. You can practice, run test cases, and work on assignments from your browser.\cr
Learn more about the Coursera Lab Sandbox and how to use the RStudio sandbox \cr
environment (including how to upload and download files) in the \href{https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/360062301971}{Learner Help Center}. \cr

\section{How can I get started?}{
\enumerate{
 \item First, read \href{preview?file=~\%2FGetting+Started+with+Your+Lab.rd}{Getting Started with Your Lab} for important course-specific guidance. \cr
 \item Download any assessment or starter files that were included in the course \cr
 instructions and materials. You can download most files by clicking on them. \cr
 If the file opens in a new browser tab, right click on a blank area of the \cr
 browser page and select Save As to save your file locally.\cr
 \item Upload your files into the Lab Sandbox and complete the course work.\cr
 \item Once you have completed your work in the lab sandbox, save your work and \cr
 download it locally.
 \item When you’re done, save your work in your sandbox.\cr
}

\section{How can I receive a score for work completed in the Lab Sandbox?}{
\enumerate{
 \item To receive a score for your work within Coursera, follow the course \cr 
      instructions listed within each assignment. 
 \item To receive a score for your Swirl Programming Assignments, \cr
       follow Swirl instructions to submit your work. \cr 
       Otherwise, if you’re working on another Programming Assignment \cr
       or Peer Review, you can download your Lab files to your \cr 
       local computer and upload them directly to the \cr
       assignment. If you are working on a Quiz, you can use \cr 
       your Lab environment to complete your work and then \cr 
       select your responses directly within the quiz.\cr
 \item If you have any questions as you get started, we recommend reviewing \cr
  \href{preview?file=~\%2FGetting+Started+with+Your+Lab.rd}{Getting Started with Your Lab} for course-specific guidance \cr 
  on how to work with the Lab Sandbox for this course.

\section{How can I get help with my Lab Sandbox?}{
You can learn more about how to use the Lab Sandbox environment and find tips to \cr 
troubleshoot in the \href{https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/360062301971}{Learner Help Center}.\cr \cr
Coursera currently maintains Lab Sandboxes and course instructors don’t have the \cr
ability to modify or troubleshoot sandbox environments. If you do run into any \cr
time sensitive platform issues, instead of contacting the course instructor \cr 
and/or staff, reach out to our 24/7 chat support in the \href{https://learner.coursera.help/hc}{Learner Help Center}.

Happy learning!
